# Bit Error Rate (BER) Measurement using PRBS-11

This document explains the theory and functionality of a system designed to measure Bit Error Rate (BER) using a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS-11).

## What is BER?

Bit Error Rate (BER) is a fundamental metric in digital communication systems. It quantifies the number of bit errors that occur in a transmitted bit stream over a given time or number of transmitted bits. Essentially, it's the ratio of erroneous bits to the total number of transmitted bits. A lower BER indicates a more reliable communication link.

## Why PRBS-11?

PRBS-11 is a specific type of pseudo-random sequence. It's a 2047-bit long pattern generated by an 11-stage Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). Here's why it's useful:

* **Known Pattern:** The PRBS-11 sequence is deterministic and reproducible. This means both the transmitter and receiver can generate the same sequence.
* **Random-like Properties:** It exhibits statistical properties that resemble a random sequence, making it suitable for testing various communication systems.
* **Repeatability:** The sequence repeats after 2047 bits, allowing for consistent and repeatable measurements.

## How it Works

1.  **Transmission:**
    * A known PRBS-11 sequence is generated and transmitted through the communication channel.

2.  **Reception:**
    * The received signal is processed to recover the bit stream.
    * A local PRBS-11 generator creates an identical reference sequence.

3.  **Comparison:**
    * The received bit stream is compared bit-by-bit with the locally generated reference PRBS-11 sequence.
    * Any differences between the received and reference bits are counted as errors.

4.  **BER Calculation:**
    * The BER is calculated by dividing the number of counted errors by the total number of bits received within a specified measurement window.

## Key Features

* **Accurate BER Measurement:** The system is designed to provide accurate BER measurements down to $10^{-8}$, enabling the evaluation of high-quality communication links.
* **Adjustable Measurement Window:** Users can adjust the measurement window from 1,000 bits to 1,000,000,000 bits. This allows for a trade-off between the BER range and the measurement duration. A larger window provides a more accurate measurement of lower BER values but requires a longer measurement time.
* **Fast Automatic Synchronization:** The system incorporates fast automatic synchronization to quickly align the received bit stream with the locally generated reference sequence.
* **Cycle Slip Detection:** The system can detect cycle slips, which occur when the receiver loses synchronization with the transmitted sequence.
* **32-bit Cumulative BER Counter:** A 32-bit cumulative BER counter is provided for long-duration measurements, allowing for the accumulation of error counts over extended periods.
* **Input Selection:** The system offers 1-bit serial or 2-bit parallel input selection (I before Q or I/Q), providing flexibility for different input signal formats.
* **ComScope Software:** The ComScope software allows users to capture and display key internal signals in real-time on a host computer, providing detailed insights into the measurement process.
* **Power Supply:** The system operates on a standard 220 V power supply, with 50 Hz or 60 Hz frequency options available.
* **Low Power Consumption:** The system consumes approximately 2.5 VA of power.

## Practical Applications

This system is used to test and evaluate the performance of various digital communication systems, including:

* Fiber optic communication systems
* Wireless communication systems
* Satellite communication systems
* Digital transmission links

## In Simple Terms

Imagine you're sending a secret code (PRBS-11) to a friend. You also have a copy of the code. When you receive your friend's message, you compare it to your original code. Any mistakes are counted, and the BER tells you how many mistakes were made out of the total message. You can choose to check a small part of the message quickly or a large part for very accurate results.
